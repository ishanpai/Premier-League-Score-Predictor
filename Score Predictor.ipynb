    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data science project aims to predict the outcome of premier league matches for gameweek 30 by giving teams an attack rating (based on goals scored and xG) and a defense rating (based on goals conceded and xG against). The rating also takes into account form, giving more recent matches more importance than matches well in the past. We start with a very simple model and build up towards more detailed models that would better capture the parameters that would affect the score of a football match.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is still just a preliminary idea and a lot of the hyper-parameters should be trained such as how fast the weights decay, the thresholds for predicting wins, draws, and losses. Many more factors should also be taken into consideration such as past results from the same fixture, player injuries, etc. This has the potential of being further expanded upon to get a nice classification model that would predict every match as a home win, draw or away win."

    "We assume that the number of goals a team scores in a match is given by a Poisson distribution with a given mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a very simple poisson model. The mean is merely calculated as the mean of the goals scored in the season until that match (until matchday 30 for us). \n",
    "\n",
    "We then give 4 sets of results for the fixtures. The first just reports the means to see what we would expect on average. This does not allow for any randomness.\n",
    "The next simulates a poisson random variable 5 times and takes the average of these. This is to ensure some robustness of results but at the same time allowing for randomness as well.\n",
    "The third shows 1 realization of the poisson random variable, giving the result some real randomness.\n",
    "The last shows the most likely result. This is not particularly interesting as it does not vary much between teams as a large range of means would give the same most likely result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation of course depends on the random seed and therefore has some element of randomness in it and therefore predicts more unlikely results as well but over the season we expect the mean to be somewhere near the mean input into the system."

    "Of course, this simple model is not going to be very good but it is a good starting point and we will improve it from here. One of the major drawbacks of this model is that it does not take into account any defensive ability of the teams whatsoever, and so we deal with this next.\n",

    "## Taking into account defensive scores\n",
    "We now include a defensive score in the analysis as well. The defensive score for a team is the number of goals conceded per game on average. We then take the mean of the poisson distribution to be the average of the goals scored per game of a team and the goals conceded per game of the opposing team. So, for example, to predict the Chelsea vs West Brom game, we would see how many goals Chelsea scores on average per game and how many goals West Brom concedes on average per game to come up with the mean for the poisson distrubution.\n"

    "We see a few changes here. The most notable is that Arsenal vs Liverpool has now tipped in favour of the gunners. This would be due to a combination of the Gunners' good form as well as the Reds' defensive woes in the past weeeks. Southampton vs Burnley has also now tipped the other way with Burnley the favourites for the game.\n",

    "Another feature we can include in the model is whether the match is home or away. In normal circumstances this would play a huge factor in the outcome of matches as the home team gets the support of the thousands of fans in the stadium. Notable examples would be Liverpool's home record in the last few seasons and Chelsea's home record where they went unbeaten at home for 86 games in a row. This year however, due to the lack of fans in the stadium, the difference between home games and away games doesn't seem to be much. So far this season we have seen 118 home wins, 68 draws, 114 away wins. This shows no evidence of any home advantage and therefore I will not consider this in the model right now.\n"

    "\n",
    "So far we have only been using goals as our form of data in order to predict games. The use of xG has exploded over the last few years due to its ability to capture the expected number of goals a team should have scored, removing some good or bad luck the team may have had in the game. One thing to note is that xG should not be used as the be all and end all because it does say something about a team or player who has many more goals than xG and vice versa. We therefore look at both, goals and xG. We therefore look at the average of these two."

    "We now discuss some of the drawbacks of assuming a poisson distribution. Firstly, a poisson distribution assumes that goals are independent to each other which can definitely be argued. When there is a goal in a match, the likelihood of more goals increases as the dynamic of the match changes and more chances get created as a result of a more open game in general. Another drawback of the poisson distribution is that it takes integer values from 0 to infinity. It assigns some non-zero probability to a team scoring 20 goals for instance but we know that such an event is impossible and should have probability 0. It is a little unclear where the stopping point should be though as we would not have expected leicester or manu to score 9 goals against southampton but they did. Lastly, this is only one realization of the poisson random variable and is therefore not at all robust. We can take more realizations and average over this, but we still do want to capture some element of randomness into the system as unlikely events do occur and averaging will just move us towards the mean."

We would like to find the probability of a home win, a draw, and an away win so that we can compare with betting websites. We then look at these as theoretical values and would bet accordingly. For example, if the probability implied by the betting odds are much lower than that given with the model, we would want to be on that result. We also find probabilities for the total number of goals in a match, and the win margin.\n",
